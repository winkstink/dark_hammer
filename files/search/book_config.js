NATO units patrolling the latest eastern European flashpoint are suddenly crippled by a cyber sneak attack through a faulty security patch. As their tanks drive blindly in circles, the en- emy’s autonomous armor cuts them to pieces. Half a world away, American infantry pinned down by invading troops are readying for a last stand when they’re authorized to throw the “Dark Hammer” – a cyber-weapon of last resort, rendering their op- ponents’ systems defenseless. At home, a deadly missile attack on Houston is traced to an unlikely traitor – a disillusioned officer secretly manipulated through social media until he cracks. Mercenary hackers frame him as a radicalized terrorist. And on Thanksgiving, a pair of drones carrying high explosives and a biological weapon attack an automated Army depot, detonating a combustible combination of shipments covertly assembled by local terrorists. The casualties are unimaginable. These stories aren’t the plot of the latest blockbuster videogame or paperback thriller. They’re graphic novellas commissioned by the Army Cyber Institute at West Point as both a provocation and a warning cloaked in the familiar form of comic books. The Dark Hammer series and its sequels – collected here for the first time in print – are testa- ment to the Army Cyber Institute’s mission to explore new methods, draw upon the broad expertise of its partners, and disseminate its findings far and wide to educate Army leaders on future cyber threats. What you’re about to read is the product of hundreds of hours of brainstorming, writing, and drawing by dozens of soldiers, cyberwar- fare experts, futurists, and artists to craft plausible futures that are nominally science fiction, but rooted in the facts. These stories are already being taught in the classrooms of West Point and Annapo- lis, have been covered in the pages of America’s most prestigious technology journal and hipster media outlets, and have even been translated by allies and adversaries alike to understand the Army’s thinking. In doing so, they’ve become a force multiplier for addressing security challenges through a broad array of public, private, and military part- ners who might never have connected without these graphic novellas. “Graphic novellas are a medium with a rich tradition of use by the U.S. Army,” said LTG (Retired) Rhett A. Hernandez, former commander of the U.S. Army Cyber Command. “For generations, the Army has suc- cessfully used this medium for conveying important messages across the force. Today, the Army Cyber Institute is continuing this tradition based on science fiction prototypes of cyber threats it may encounter on future battlefields. This retrospective book discusses the Army’s historical use of the medium, and how it is being applied as a tool for educating the modern cyber force.” Introduction 7 ","The ACI was created in 2012 as a think tank complementing U.S. Army Cyber Command, responsible for preventing strategic surprise and ensuring the Army’s dominance by scanning new developments on a three- to ten-year horizon. Stationed at West Point, the ACI was conceived as a bridge between the Army and cyber experts in the intel- ligence community, government, academia, and industry, all in the name of building intellectual capital and promoting innovation. “Sometimes, visuals are more enticing than the written word. We hoped the medium would allow us to explore things that could really generate some discussions.” - Colonel Andrew O. Hall U.S. Army Cyber Institute Director Given this charter, the ACI strove to push the boundaries of form as well as content. In 2016, the institute convened representatives from New York City’s finance, energy, telecommunications, and emergency man- agement sectors to participate in a two-day threatcasting workshop to identify and explore possible future threats. One takeaway was the need for a common language across the cyber domain, accessible to experts and laymen alike. This strengthened the staff’s resolve to explore uncon- ventional methods of reaching a wider audience. “Most challenges in the cyber domain aren’t just going to affect the mili- tary, but society-at-large,” said Lt. Col. Natalie Vanatta, the ACI’s deputy chief of research. “Let’s be honest, how many people can you convince to read a 150-page technical report?” The institute is also charged with embracing a diversity of ideas as well as audiences. This led ACI director Col. Andrew O. Hall to invite the futurist Brian David Johnson to host a workshop at West Point in August 2016. Formerly Intel’s resident futurist, Johnson had since joined Arizona State University to launch and direct its Threatcasting Lab. “Threatcasting” is a framework combining technical research with social science, cultural history, economic data, and popular trends to map a range of possible and probable threats a decade in the future. Johnson’s twist is to combine the practice with a related discipline of his own in- vention, “science fiction prototyping,” to ground these futures in tailored narratives – a person in a place doing something – rather than generic scenarios. This has the advantage of giving participants a lens through which to identify actions, indicators, and concrete steps that can be taken today to disrupt, mitigate, and recover from attacks or disruption. Curious as to whether threatcasting would work in a military context, the institute convened a mix of ACI staff and outside experts – including Citigroup, the NYPD, and X-Men writer Chris Claremont – to envision a widening attack plain of cyber threats through 2027. It would prove to be a dress rehearsal for the more ambitious project Col. Hall had in mind. By the time Johnson’s 150-page technical report was published the following spring, ACI had decided to proceed with an entire series of threatcasting workshops, only this time their ideas would form the plots of graphic novellas rather than fill a technical appendix. “Sometimes, visuals are more enticing than the written word,” explained Col. Hall. “There’s also a certain amount of academic freedom – no one’s expect- ing it to be an official government publication when it’s a sci-fi graphic novella. We hoped the medium would allow us to explore things that could really generate some discussions.” Why graphic novellas? As it turns out, the Army has a long history of using visual storytelling as a teaching tool, beginning with the enlist- ment of Will Eisner during World War II. The legendary Eisner – whose name adorns the comic industry’s Hall of Fame and highest awards – was already famous for penning The Spirit when he enlisted fol- lowing Pearl Harbor. He soon created the instructional comic strip and titular character Joe Dope for Army Motors magazine, and following the war created PS, The Preventative  8 Introduction "," Maintenance Monthly. Eisner’s illustrations taught an entire generation of soldiers how to clean and care for the equipment (and the consequenc- es if they didn’t) before his departure in 1971; the magazine continues publication in app form today. Another impetus was the recent renaissance in military science fiction. Just as authors such as Tom Clancy had precisely imagined superpower clashes in the 1980s, a new crop of bestsellers including Max Brooks’ World War Z and Peter W. Singer’s and August Cole’s Ghost Fleet used future conflicts and calamities as a pretext to extrapolate from current trends. (Cole would later participate in one of the workshops and Brooks would contribute an afterword to a later installment in the series.) By the fall of 2017, what would become Dark Hammer had begun taking shape. A creative team led by Johnson as writer and facilitator, alongside Nike designer Sandy Winkelman as creative director, would run workshops at West Point, in Washington, D.C., at Arizona State, and at Fort Meade, refining the output from each into scripts before commis- sioning Marvel and D.C. Comics veterans to pencil, ink, and color them. Throughout the process, Army experts drawn from various roles across the service branches – such as armor and logistics – would ensure the “futuristic” weapons and equipment depicted wouldn’t be so unrealistic as to trigger readers’ disbelief. The final workshop in Fort Meade was typical of the process. For three days, a dozen participants gathered in a community center on base pro- ceeded through Johnson’s exercises. An initial instruction to propose so- lutions for every dilemma was quickly discarded, encouraging everyone to embrace their darkest fears. Slowly, patterns and themes emerged – secreting a threat inside the Army’s supply chain; the nightmare of being trapped inside a hacked tank. Naturally, it wasn’t until the workshop was over – when participants were relaxing over dinner – that the best ideas began to flow in a tor- rent. “We came up with the outlines for the first three stories in a matter of hours,” said Johnson. “Creatively, it was kismet.” “I love this medium. We’re only beginning to scratch the surface of its potential for teaching and dynamic storytelling.” - Steve Buccellato Editor for D.C. Comics Introduction 9 ","But it wasn’t quite so simple. Over the next month, the creative team developed these ideas further, conceptualizing what a “realistic” autono- mous tank or insect-sized drone might resemble in 2027. Simultane- ously, they mapped the raw scenarios onto characters and plots before drafting scripts for the ACI’s approval. Once that was finished, it was time to turn these stories into graphic novellas. “I wanted to show how cyber will be an integral part of the Army’s life in the future.” - Lt. Col. Natalie Vanatta Academy Professor U.S. Army Cyber Institute To that end, the team turned to Steve Buccellato, who’d started working for Marvel when he was just sixteen, and is now an editor for D.C. Com- ics. Working closely with them to define the visual style of each story, Buccellato drew upon his extensive Rolodex to select artists with the appropriate strengths. For the tank battle of “Silent Ruin,” for example, he suggested Don Hudson – a Spider-Man and Captain America veteran whose work on historical comics made him a perfect fit for the high degree of detail required. Malaysian artist Kinsun Loh then painted over Hudson’s pencils, giving the finished product a lush, photo-realistic feel. For the later story “Hero,” in which a tiny, artificially-intelligent drone penetrates a nightclub, Buccellato turned to D.C. colleague Jason Bad- ower, whose rich, multilayered work for The Flash and Wonder Woman lent perspective to how a drone might filter through potential terrorist suspects. “I love this medium,” Buccellato said. “We’re only beginning to scratch the surface of its potential for teaching and dynamic storytell- ing.” While reading the finished product, one might alternately feel elation (at the victory of “Dark Hammer”), dread, or even horror. Perhaps the most evocative for front-line Army staff is “Silent Ruin,” in which tanks dispatched to guard a disputed border are at first invisibly attacked by enemy forces. Exploiting a vulnerability routine maintenance should have patched, they seize control of the U.S. Army’s tanks, leaving the soldiers trapped inside as sitting ducks for hostile fire – or worse, killed by their malfunctioning vehicles. The tank is symbolic of the Army, and despite its apparent invulner- ability frequently injures crews during training accidents. “I wanted to open people’s eyes to the fact that every single mechanical failure in a tank due to an accident or maintenance could also be done by a cyber effect,” said Lt. Col. Vanatta. “I wanted to show how cyber will be an integral part of the Army’s life in the future.” Another story, “11-25-27,” draws upon the iconography of Thanksgiving (with a serving robot completing the Norman Rockwell-style family por- trait) and fears of another 9/11 to depict how hackers loose inside the Army’s supply chain might wreak undetectable havoc. Slowly but surely, terrorists fool algorithmic quartermasters into assembling a powder keg in the Port of Seattle – one detonated by drone-delivered explosives and a synthetic biological agent. The threats in this case are also clear: the dangers of understaffing and an over-reliance on automation; insufficient safeguards in (supposedly) lower priority systems; and the hazards posed by new technologies – especially the potential for terrorists to manufacture untraceable biologi- cal weapons through commercial genetic editing tools and 3D printers.   10 Introduction Technology also plays the titular role in “Hero,” in which a drone dis- patched to root out a terrorist conspiracy flits through a room, eaves- dropping on conversations for keywords related to an upcoming peace ","summit. A plot to bomb the proceedings is foiled, thanks to the ongoing miniaturization of drones – which in this instance is no bigger than a housefly – and advances in Artificial Intelligence and edge computing enabling it to process their intentions on the spot. After several months of illustration, iteration, and experimentation, the first four Dark Hammer graphic novellas were published to critical acclaim in January 2018. Media outlets as diverse at IEEE Spectrum, Popular Mechanics, and Motherboard (a Vice Media publication) hailed their attention to detail and unflinching realism. “Fiction can be a powerful tool for better grasping realities,” Ghost Fleet co-author Peter W. Singer explained to Motherboard. “It allows you to explore ‘what if’s’ from trends in play, connect with the human and emotional side that is so resonant in both storytelling and the real world, as well as reach a wider set of readers than a memorandum.” edented alliances of public and private partners. Dark Hammer is both designed to help them find a common language, and to shake them out of complacency. To that end, threatcasting will remain a part of West Point’s curriculum as part of a course designed in conjunction with the Threatcasting Lab at Arizona State. Because to paraphrase the computing pioneer Alan Kay, the best way to predict – or prevent – the future is to invent it. “Our thought was to put these stories out, spread these ideas into the ecosystem, and build a community. Our hope is to influence our partners in industry and academia, as well as the junior leaders within the Army who we believe will have to deal with these issues in the future.” - Colonel Andrew O. Hall U.S. Army Cyber Institute Director   A second batch of stories, including “Hero,” would be published later that year, drawn from ideas in the original sessions and ideated further by the creative team. By fall, “Hero” was being taught to cadets at West Point, and “Silent Ruin” had been translated into Russian (presumably for the edification of its army officers). “Our thought was to put these stories out, spread these ideas into the ecosystem, and build a community,” said Col. Hall. “Our hope is to influence our partners in industry and academia, as well as the junior leaders within the Army who we believe will have to deal with these issues in the future.” This book is only the latest installment in the Army’s long tradition of grappling with uncertainty and exploring the edges of the future. If there is one lesson to be learned from the 21st Century (so far), it’s that the range of potential enemies has expanded to include totally unforeseen actors, and that countering these threats will require equally unprec- Introduction 11 "," Silent Ruin \[Phase 1\] 12 Silent Ruin "," Technology is evolving faster and faster ... but our military doctrine, organization, training, leadership, personnel, and education models are struggling to keep the same pace.

Silent Ruin 21 "," Silent Ruin Development One of the primary goals of a science fiction prototype (SFP) is to present a possible and probable future. For “Silent Ruin”, we used both Arizona State University’s threatcasting reports and the science fiction prototyping workshop at Fort Meade as technical inputs to explore a future threat on tanks that might be hacked and disabled on the battlefield. “Silent Ruin” was a unique SFP because there was a requirement that every aspect of the tanks be technically correct. Some fictional deptic- tions of military hardware aren’t always completely accurate. For the sake of the drama and the fictional deptiction, the creators sometimes cut corners. However, the purpose of this SFP was to start a discus- sion about the real and possible threats to tanks. If an informed, military-trained reader saw something wrong with the details or layout of the tank, it would have taken them out of the fictional future and stopped the conversation. In short, we had to get it right. To do this, we worked with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), AKA Tank- ers – soldiers who had spent their careers in tanks. From the helmets to the interior and even the language, these Tankers helped us adjust our depiction and ensure technical accuracy. A secondary theme that flows throughout “Silent Ruin” is one that is never mentioned in the text, but is clearly present, which is the design of the weapons. It is most apparent with the drones. In this future, the adversary has continued to fund its military, developing new technol- ogy and innovations. The United States and its allies have not. This underfunding can be seen in the design and condition of the drones. The adversary’s drones are sleek and new while the U.S. drones are battered and outdated. This secondary visual theme supports the primary threat description of tanks getting hacked, but it also gives depth and subtlety to a broader complex scenario.  22 Silent Ruin ","  Every aspect of the tank needed to be technically accurate – from the helmets and displays to the weapons details.        Silent Ruin 23 "," Once the technical aspects of the tank’s interior were correct, we could use the in- terior and claustrophobic proximity of each soldier in the tank to create tension as the story went from bad to worse.     24 Silent Ruin "," The early drawings show the drones as equals. Although their design is different, they are evenly matched and depicted as equals. Later versions highlight the technological superiority of the adversary’s drones and the neglect and outdated nature of the U.S. drones. Even how the drones are positioned in the frame gives the adversary’s drones prominence.    Silent Ruin 25 "," DArk Hammer \[Phase 2\] 26 Dark Hammer ","  We re-defined how the Army operated after Vietnam to fight the Cold War. We shifted from Cold War thinking to more than a decade of counterinsurgency operations. Maybe it is time to redefine how we fight the next generation of adversaries – both on the ground, in the air, and in cyberspace. Cyber and Electronic Warfare effects must become just another option that a commander can employ to meet their objectives. Our adversaries think like this. Our adversaries are embracing change.

In the near future, they will be just as deadly.” - Dr. George Cybenko Dartmouth College ","AFTERWORD In battle, a ground commander might employ multiple effects, both lethal and non-lethal. While the authorization to use weapons like a mortar lies with a lower level commander, like a squad or platoon leader, others, like a Hellfire missile, might lie with decision-makers up the chain of command. Cyber is designed in a similar manner. It is a scalable, non-lethal effect that, if used properly, can set battlefield conditions for the commander to pursue their objectives. What supported Lt. Reed’s push through the enemy lines? First, we had cyber capabilities developed to support the ground scheme of maneuver. Second, we had a secure, actively defended network to ensure that the enemy could not have a similar effect on our troops in contact. Third, our forces successfully operated simultaneously in multiple contested domains–in the air, on the ground, and in cyber. How do we ensure that these three factors will be commonplace on the battlefield? Not only do we need to think about what capabilities our forces will need, but also the authorities they should have. We need to educate the force about how technical capabilities can support the fight. How do we tackle cyber literacy in our formations? We need to think about how everyday actions we take in garrison can affect our defensive posture. How should we rethink our plays and game plan to change the culture and mindset of our forces? Dark Hammer 35 "," DArk Hammer Development In “Dark Hammer”, we explored a threat future in which a cyber weapon could be used offensively to gain a strategic advantage. To draw the audience into the drama, we wanted to make the story hu- man, about the soldiers on the ground, and how this global conflict was affecting them personally. We placed Keith and Crystal Reed at the center of the graphic novella. The entire science fiction prototype (SFP) can be seen as a brother and sister story. We begin and end with them, and even have Crystal turn the tables on her big brother. Once we had pinned the story to Keith and Crystal, we could expand the scope and show the global conflict escalating around them. Their small family drama allowed the creative team to expand the severity of the conflict on the Han Chiu peninsula.  36 Dark Hammer "," The graphic novella ends with the Reeds. Crys- tal turns the tables on her brother, using the old football analogy from their childhood. The con- nection between the family in the story grounds the entire SFP, reminding us of the human cost and the real-life stakes in a global conflict. We wanted to quickly establish the Reeds as a typical family with a strong military background. The pickup game of football the local kids play foreshadows the coming global conflict.     Dark Hammer 37 "," In “Dark Hammer”, there is a tension between the personal nature of the story and the escalating global conflict. We were careful to balance the two, always pushing ourselves to heighten the tension by moving from the up close view of the people in the story to the backdrop of the expansive conflict.       38 Dark Hammer ","    Once the conflict breaks out at the end of the story, we used civilians as a way to juxtapose the effects of the conflicts on not only the soldiers, but people who were trapped in the city as well.

We’re all thankful for robots that don’t need a day off for Thanksgiving. But who’s watching the robots to see what ingredients were mixed together? In the future, machines will increasingly automate menial and complex tasks. How do we ensure the effectiveness of safety- related functions? Have we taken into account not just the chance of random failures, but also acts of an adversary seeking to subvert these systems? Whereas developing high-performing human operators and safety personnel once took decades of training and experience, it can now be imparted to machines in seconds. However, does this knowledge contain everything a machine needs to know “in case of emergency?” In a world where safety is not the only concern, how do we understand the danger of cyber threats combined with the physical world? As cyber-physical systems and interactions become more complex, how do we visualize the threat adequately and defend ourselves accordingly?

With increasing physical and digital automation, the possibility and probability of “11/25/27” is quite real. Based on “The Widening Attack Plain”, an Arizona State University’s Threatcasting Lab report, this SFP cautions what might happen if we take too many people out of the loop and rely too much on the efficiency of machines and artificial intelligence to run our systems. The style of this SFP was meant to emphasize the vastness and com- plexity of the supply chain landscape. We only see small glimpses of people. Unlike other SFPs, there are no specific characters. Here we briefly see a frustrated engineer making a phone call or a family sitting down to Thanksgiving dinner. None of the characters are named. This was meant to further emphasize that, although greatly impacted by the terror attack, the humans are secondary participants to the technology in the story.  50 11/25/27 ","  Moluptatum fuga.

It was essential that the supply chains in “11/25/27” were as accurate as possible. Using Subject Matter Experts, we combed through each frame focusing on both the reality of current military supply chains and what might be possible in the near future.

We must learn how to deal not only with the threat from malicious insiders, but also under-trained personnel, accident prone individuals, negligent workers, overwhelmed personnel, mismanaged contractors, and the list goes on. Awareness is the first step. Use this graphic novella to start the conversation. 62 Engineering a Traitor "," Engineering a Traitor Development In the near future, technological advances such as artifcial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, and the continued proliferation of social networking sites for the delivery of news and events will dramatically reshape the attack landscape. “Engineering a Traitor” explores this possible reality. Would it be possible to take an average soldier and shape their reality so that they would become a traitor without even knowing it?  Engineering a Traitor 63 ","   In the story, the interlocking web of social networking sites, digital communications, and financial transactions provide a large vulnerability for our main character, Jay Roberts. By selectively interfering with Roberts’ communications, news feeds, and financial transac- tions, he is separated from his family support network, making him a target for manipula- tion. Facilitated by technology, Roberts is repeatedly nudged in the wrong direction. And with enough digital nudges over a long period of time, Roberts is influenced to take a critical action in the physical world. At this point in the story, his perception of reality has become so altered that his treason feels like his only logical step.     64 Engineering a Traitor ","    Artificial Intelligence is used by the hackers to shape Jay Roberts’ reality, making small changes in the news that he reads and the communications he receives. But the hackers don’t just alter Roberts’ version of reality, they also shape the world’s view of Roberts. The same technology they have used to transform him into a traitor is used to leave a falsified digital trail. During the investi- gation into his single treasonous act, Roberts appears to have become radicalized. The adversaries have made the world believe that Roberts is a traitor at the same time they were turning him into one.  Engineering a Traitor 65 "," Hero \[Phase 5\] 66 Hero "," Technology is evolving at a fast pace – the miniaturization of processing power combined with advancements in algorithms and sensor technology could radically change how our future looks. It will be an era of accelerated human progress. Therefore, we must have agile, adaptive organizations that continually encourage innovation while weighing the risk versus reward. We must embrace change in our thinking and actions in order to remain successful. This science fiction prototype is meant to spark these conversations. Lt. Col. Natalie Vanatta Academy Professor U.S. Army Cyber Institute Hero 67 "," 68 Hero HERO The year is 2028. Amid chemical attacks and global conflict, a rumored summit is about to convene in a secret location. Tensions are high. Rumors are rampant. A terror cell has infiltrated the summit and an attack is imminent. Who can gather the crucial information needed and disarm the threat? It’s time for an unlikely hero. "," Hero 69 "," 70 Hero "," Hero 71 ","     BEGINNING TRANSMISSION..   TRANSMISSION COMPLETE. The much rumored summit between the International Coalition and Opposition Forces, kicked off today, at a new undisclosed and secure location. An anonymous tip last night to the authorities, led to the arrests of a terrorist faction that was found to have ties to the original summit venue, here on King street.   Authorities announced that King Street is on lockdown as chemical terror plot is thwarted a day before attack...  72 Hero EXITING.. ","“Artificial intelligence (AI) is today what aviation was 100 years ago. Like that other disruptive technology, we cannot ignore how AI will change our world.” AFTERWORD - Max Brooks Best-selling author  In this science fiction prototype (SFP), our miniature hero was a vital member of the team - an autonomous robot searching for covert clues to prevent an attack. What if in the future your teammates are not all human? What if you worked beside a mechanical device, connected to a robust sensor network, that could process and analyze terabytes of data at machine speed real-time to develop an understanding of the environment – work that would take humans months or years? While this might enable our victory, how do we also protect ourselves when our adversaries use it against us to exploit the initiative to create positions of relative advantage? How does this scenario reshape your concerns about privacy? Should the definition of privacy evolve to accommodate the technology, or should we force technology to work within our current definition? What might happen if our algorithms evolve past using statistical correlation to make decisions to being able to execute causational thinking? Then might we trust them to make decisions for humans without humans in the loop? Specifically from a law enforcement or judicial perspective, how would we integrate this technology into our legal system? Would a prosecutor be able to call Hero to the stand to cross-examine how they collected the evidence? Would the larger AI system that Hero feeds its data into be able to articulate to the court how the investigation evolved over time and stayed within the scope of legal allowances? While this SFP highlights both positive and adverse possibilities of future technology, our future does not have to be dismal. If we start thinking now, we can better prepare ourselves, our communities, and our organizations .... how can you help? Your ideas could be the solution! Hero 73 "," Hero Development “Hero” explores a future of miniaturized robotics and shrinking com- putational power. The central issue at the heart of this science fiction prototype (SFP) is autonomous surveillance. There is a long history and legal precedent for traditional human-to-human surveillance. But what are the technical and legal implications when the listening device is no longer human directed? For “Hero”, we designed the system architecture of the robot. We imagined that the robot would be authorized to listen to some people in the club while it would need to ignore other voices it was not authorized to record. As a result, in the story we see Hero jumping from conver- sation to conversation. Once the robot finds the people it is legally allowed to record, it stops and begins its surveillance. The intent of the SFP was to present a future that challenges today’s legal and ethical norms for surveillance.  74 Hero ","   The technical visuals throughout the SFP are used as hints to the technology that powers the robot. We focused on audio and the waveforms to show that Hero is analyzing all the voices it’s picking up, checking to see if it’s allowed to listen to them.   Hero 75 ","  Another unique aspect of the “Hero” SFP is that it was also made into a motion comic. A motion comic is not a traditional animation that might be seen on TV or in the movie theater, but rather, can be used to animate various elements of a graphic novella or story. During the planning and conceptualizing of “Hero”, the team understood that it would be both a graphic novella as well as a motion comic. Therefore, the design of the SFP was different than the rest of the SFPs in this collection. The artwork was not drawn in frames or cells as it is in a typical SFP. Instead, the visuals were large environments that Hero would navigate. The animation camera would move across these spaces and environments.    76 Hero The artwork was created in layers, giving even more of a sense of motion as Hero moved through the scenes. Finally, the sound design and graphics were added for even more depth, storytelling, and SFP accuracy. ","  One last minute change to “Hero” sprang from the motion comic approach. In the early versions of the script and artwork, the TV announcer that informs the audience that the attack has been thwarted was a traditional reporter.   In the final revisions of the SFP, we realized that a drone hov- ering by the scene projecting a hologram of a reporter would have much more visual impact. We imagined tomorrow’s news reporting being conducted in this way. It would allow reporters to get to stories faster and keep them safer as well.  Hero 77 "," 1000 Cuts \[Phase 6\] 78 1000 Cuts "," 1000 Cuts 79 "," 80 1000 Cuts 1000 Cuts A foreign criminal organization has taken advantage of known vulnerabilities in network devices and online services comprising the global Internet of things. Violations of U.S. military operational security, breached network devices, and previously exposed personal information have enabled these nefarious actors to target individual members of a U.S. military unit deployed in support of U.N. peacekeeping operations. The distributed targeting of individual members of the unit has left the entire organization distracted from their military responsibilities. Subsequently, these attacks are enough to disrupt the entire unit’s ability to adequately defend their base against the criminal organization’s attacks. In other words, the deployed unit has suffered a death by a “1000 cuts.” "," 1000 Cuts 81 "," 82 1000 Cuts "," 1000 Cuts 83 "," 84 1000 Cuts "," 1000 Cuts 85 "," 86 1000 Cuts "," 1000 Cuts 87 "," 88 1000 Cuts ","AFTERWORD As the number of personal devices connected to the Internet of things proliferates throughout the world, it causes the amount of personal information contained in this network to grow exponentially. The adoption of mobile networked devices by the global population promises to provide users with ubiquitous and efficient access to an increasing number of convenient online services. These services will require individuals to expose more of their personal information across potentially vulnerable networks in the future. As illustrated in this story, the rapid growth and use of the Internet of things not only exposes individual members of society to attacks by subversive actors or groups, but presents an existential threat to entire organizations. Could the U.S. military have prevented the attack presented in this scenario? If so, how? How do military organizations, as well as academic and commercial enterprises, implement policies, procedures, and technologies that educate their members and prevent these sorts of attacks in the near future? 1000 Cuts 89 "," 1000 Cuts Development The technologies and possible threat futures used in “1000 Cuts” were taken from the 2017 Arizona State University Threatcasting report, “The New Dogs of War”. It is a future where adversaries use artificial intelligence, the Internet of things, digital services, and connected medical devices to distract and disrupt the fighting force. We took care to make sure that each of the technologies were not too far out in the future, consulting with multiple subject matter experts (SME) to validate that each tiny attack was plausible.  90 1000 Cuts ","As medical devices are connected to the internet and are increasingly relied upon by medical professionals, they become a vulnerability that can be hacked and attached. Consulting with a SME, we identified that altering simple results like white blood cell counts could disrupt a soldier’s life. Even if upon further testing and investigation the real “normal” results are revealed, the hack would be seen as a random error, too small to be an overt attack. However, the soldier’s life and eventual deployment would be disrupted.    To the outside world, one isolated instance of bad data or a website malfunction is a mere blip, but when it’s spread across the entire fighting force it could have a large effect. Civilian services like banking are another area for distraction and disruption. Working with a banking SME, we identified that an even less sophisticated attack could be effective. The AI in the banking scenario of “1000 Cuts” doesn’t use sophisticated AI. The AI is relatively simple. It repeatedly attacks the bank’s website until it can gain access to a bank account and make the small change to the routing number.   1000 Cuts 91 "," If adversaries can disrupt a soldier’s family, then they can distract that soldier during deployment. Small acts, such as altering custody reports or DMV records, could be enough to cause havoc.   Increased communication between family members and soldiers when they are on deployment creates hazards. By disrupting a family mem- ber’s life, the adversary is in effect weaponizing that relationship, using it for an adversarial purpose.    92 1000 Cuts ","     The attacks in “1000 Cuts” are meant to be small and distributed. Because they are small they would not be identified until later – if at all. The final frames of the novella depict the scope of the attack. The final frame reveals that there is an adversary behind this death by 1000 cuts, but it’s also meant to convey that the attack is a slightly messy or not completely premeditated. The adversary knows it will disrupt the force but, they’re not completely sure how or where. Ultimately it doesn’t matter as long as the distraction happens.   1000 Cuts 93 "," Quantum Winter \[Phase 7\] 94 Quantum Winter "," Quantum Winter 95 "," 96 Quantum Winter Quantum WInter Adversaries have beaten the U.S. to the punch, acquiring quantum computing capabilities well ahead of the technological world’s expectations. The ramifications of the enemy’s advantage in computational power are felt by a team of U.S. Army technical soldiers during a tactical mission. The team suffers the chaotic effects of the enemy’s advantage, leaving them immobilized by enemy fire and unable to communicate for fear of being more precisely located. Outside, the nation’s power grid is under constant cyber attacks, producing persistent rolling brown outs. With no encryption, banking systems are hacked, destabilizing the economy and inciting civilian riots in major urban centers. The nation is frozen in a “quantum winter,” unable to defend itself, experiencing the prolonged effects of losing the technological race in computational power. "," Quantum Winter 97 "," 98 Quantum Winter "," Quantum Winter 99 "," 100 Quantum Winter ","AFTERWORD Institutions within nation-states continue to aggressively pursue the achievement of quantum supremacy. Most of these endeavors aspire to solve some of the world’s most difficult mathematical problems. One thing holds true, whichever nation possesses “quantum supremacy” first has the capability to shift global hegemony in their favor. Quantum computing gives the U.S.’ adversaries the capability to crack the most sophisticated encryption algorithms, protecting our national security information. This capability will enable its possessors to wreak chaos and havoc on the information networks of any nation that opposes its will. What can the U.S. do to assure the security of information contained within our national information infrastructure if we lose the quantum race? How do we pursue encryption research designed to address information security in the “post-quantum” world? What battlefield systems could be emplaced to counter the effects of a “quantum winter” from enemies possessing this advantage? As illustrated in this story, enemies with quantum computing capabilities could render U.S. military units completely isolated, confused, and powerless. The need to develop new “quantum proof” encryption algorithms has never been greater. While quantum computing promises a lot of good for the world, it also poses an existential threat to our national security. Quantum Winter 101 "," Quantum Winter Development The race towards a functioning quantum computer is often widely discussed, but not understood. What would it be like if the United States lost the quantum race? How would we find out? How would we recover? In this science fiction prototype, we not only focused on the effects of losing the quantum race on the military, but also on the broader world as well. Showing these second and third order effects illustrated how this would heighten the destabilizing effect on the military. In the drama of “Quantum Winter”, the extent of the attacks and effects are far too vast for a single character to understand them all. The audience is only given a sliver of information, a flashing glimpse of chaos to seed longer, deeper conversations.  102 Quantum Winter "," The effects of losing the quantum race could go far beyond encryption. Certainly, not being able to send private messages would be catastrophic for the military. But what about the civilian disruptions, and the disruptions to vital utilities like the power grid? These wide-ranging effects play out both inside the small bunker in this story, as well as across the nation.   Quantum Winter 103 ","     104 Quantum Winter "," Because the possible effects of losing the quantum race are so vast, the creative team created a small drama, only giving the audience a small slice of what could happen. Packing each frame with references to riots, looting, bank failures and attacks, was meant to cast a wide net for the audience to have many different conversations and debates about this possible future.    Quantum Winter 105 "," Insider Threat \[Phase 8\] 106 Insider Threat "," Insider Threat 107 "," 108 Insider Threat Insider Threat A concerned serviceman observes his counterpart acting erratically – plotting to cripple or contaminate the entire water system of a U.S. Army base. Suspicious behaviors observed over the course of a year point to a potential insider threat. Insider threats are so dangerous because they are a betrayal of trust. Foundational to the U.S. military is the trust between service members. Erratic behavior doesn’t automatically indicate a possible insider threat, nor should service members spend their days suspicious of their colleagues. In a time when technology has empowered soldiers to be more effective and efficient, these threats are increasingly hazardous. How can we create a culture of awareness and support to catch problems early and disrupt a possible insider threat before it ever exists? "," Insider Threat 109 "," 110 Insider Threat "," Insider Threat 111 "," 112 Insider Threat ","AFTERWORD An insider threat is a malicious threat to an organization that comes from people within the organization, such as employees, former employees, contractors, or business associates, who have inside information concerning the organization’s security practices, data, and computer systems. Tackling insider threats requires a combination of techniques from the technical, the sociological, and the socio-technical domains. How organizations go about tackling this issue without creating a culture of distrust or suspicion is the crux of the problem. In this story, behavior was the indicator of a potential insider threat. While these vary depending on the personality and motivation of a potentially malicious insider, there are common patterns that can be observed. Should Lisa have taken Jeff more seriously and launched an immediate investigation? What are some of the indicators in Ritter’s behavior that could have been addressed early? If Jeff’s interpretations of Ritter’s behaviors turn out to be false, how should Lisa approach the situation without creating organizational trust issues? An integrated effort to deter, understand, detect, and mitigate the risks from insider threats is critical. How should the U.S. military promote the reporting of suspicious activities without promoting an atmosphere of distrust within the organization? Insider Threat 113 "," Insider THreat Development Insider threats pose a real and substantial threat to security. By their very nature, they are hard to detect early because they are a betrayal of trust. In the near future, technology will allow soldiers greater power, communications ability, and collapse the distance between the flash and the bang of a threat. How can we make sure that the fighting force is resilient and can take the stress that comes with the job? How do we sensitize others to catch these early warning signals?  114 Insider Threat ","Consulting with a subject matter expert (SME), we used multiple profiles for the steps that people go through on their way to becoming an insider threat.   Insider Threat 115 ","Specific stressors can push a person towards becoming an insider threat. When a soldier doesn’t have the resiliency or the social network to act as a safety net, they could more easily slide towards becoming a threat. In this science fiction prototype (SFP), the creative team included multiple clues that Ritter is at risk. From the breakup of his marriage, excessive alcohol use, and despondent social networking messages – each of these psychological triggers or stressors, provided by our SME, are signs that Ritter is in trouble.      116 Insider Threat ","  “Insider Threat” ends with a cliffhanger. We don’t know if Ritter ever carries out his sabotage of the water system, or if he is moved away from action. Though the threat itself is possible, plausible, and based on other international examples, the message of the SFP is to sensitize people to the little stresses and small clues that fellow soldiers might display before a larger problem arises.
